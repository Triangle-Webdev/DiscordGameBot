How to run:
Create a file config.ts in the root directory

```js
export const token = "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
export const clientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE"
export const guildId = "YOUR_GUILD_ID_HERE"
```

You will need your own token for your bot and you will need your bot to have been added to the server you want.

Once this file is created you can deploy the commands with `npm run deploy`
and you can start the bot with `npm run dev`
